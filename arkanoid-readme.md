# Arkanoid Game Project

This Arkanoid project is a C++ implementation of the classic brick-breaking arcade game, developed using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).

## Key Features

### Game Mechanics
- **Dynamic Ball Physics**: Realistic ball movement and bouncing
- **Interactive Paddle Control**: Player-controlled paddle for ball redirection
- **Brick Destruction System**: Procedurally generated brick layouts
- **Special Brick Mechanic**: Randomly selected red "RUSH" brick adds dynamic difficulty

### Technical Highlights
- Object-oriented design with modular game object classes
- Advanced collision detection
- Smooth rendering and event-driven game loop
- Comprehensive game state management

### Special Mechanics
- Velocity boost when hitting the special red brick
- Increased paddle speed for added challenge
- Game restart functionality after win or loss

## Development Environment
- **Language**: C++
- **Graphics Library**: SFML
- **Development Approach**: Object-Oriented Programming
